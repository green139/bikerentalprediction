# bikerentalprediction
Introduction:
In this assignment, we will aim to model bike rental prediction using Machine Learning
and explore the explainability of the model.
Dataset:

1. Understand how the h2o package helps in explainability with various plots on
relation between attributes and the defect prediction.
2. Build an explainable ML model using the H2o package on the bike rental dataset
and display various plots and write your findings. (25 points)
a. Consider cnt as the target column.
b. Consider the Day data and hourly data and build two models separately.

c. Try at least two models (AutoML and any other model like gradient
boosting) for the Day dataset.
d. Discuss how various plots try to explain the amount of bikes rented
correspond to the various environmental conditions.
